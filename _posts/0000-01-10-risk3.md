### The complexities in a supply chain: Risks

- Intellectual property
Intellectual property rights such as technology, know-how, and data may be infringed within the supply chain. This can reduce competitiveness of the company, create legal disputes, and may lead to loss of customers [5].
- Bullwhip Effect
Uncertainty amplification effect often leads to de-coupling of inventory with demand fulfilment, & production planning overall. It can be mitigated using real-time data collection at the retail point, called POS data and also by using periodic checks in the warehouse to keep track of the inventory.
